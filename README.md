# Apivore

## About

The repo is a fork of [apivore 1.6.2](https://github.com/westfieldlabs/apivore/tree/0ccda01d79c8760a6efa2df38b68d58832e47665) for use with [vets-api](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/vets-api).  `apivore` is [no longer being maintained](https://github.com/westfieldlabs/apivore/issues/121) and is incompatible with Rails 6.  The code here has been changed to remove that restriction.
